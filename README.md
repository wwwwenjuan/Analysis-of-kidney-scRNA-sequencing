# Analysis-of-kidney-scRNA-sequencing
This project mainly covers the procedure of kidney single cell sequencing in C57BL/6 male mice undergoing bilateral ischemia-reperfusion for 24 hours.
You can apply this code to perform the classification and annotation functions of kidney innate cells and immune cells, etc.
If you have any questions, please contact GY Cai (caiguangyan@sina.com) and WJ Wang (wwwwenjuan@126.com).
